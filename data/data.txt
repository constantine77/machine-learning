Sure! Here's a **detailed English description of Windsurf use cases**, based on the official [Windsurf Best Practices guide](https://docs.windsurf.com/best-practices/use-cases):

---

## üß© 1. **Code Generation**

### ‚Ä¢ Boilerplate and Simple Code

Windsurf excels at generating standard code structures like classes, CRUD operations, and utility functions.

* Use tools like **Next Completion** (`‚å• + ]`), **Context Pinning**, **@-mentions**, and **Custom Context** to improve suggestion accuracy.
* Both frontend and backend code snippets are supported, including **fill-in-the-middle** (FIM) completions.

> **Tip**: Keep prompts focused and files open with relevant context to improve completions.

---

## ‚úÖ 2. **Unit Test Generation**

Windsurf can auto-generate unit tests that cover basic scenarios‚Äîup to \~60‚Äì70% test coverage.

* Enhance results by adding **@-mentions** for functions or files and including edge case details.
* For test data, explicitly define interfaces or expected shapes for more precise output.

> **Best Practice**: Iteratively refine prompts and break down test generation by component or method for better coverage.

---

## üîç 3. **Inline Commentary & Code Understanding**

* Use **Windsurf Chat** or the **Command** palette to generate function-level explanations or inline comments.
* For C/C++ developers, Windsurf can create `.h` or `.hpp` header files by generating one function at a time.

> Use **code lenses** and **@-mentions** to specify which parts of the code you want to document or explain.

---

## üìö 4. **API Documentation & Integration**

* Windsurf can generate full API documentation: parameters, return types, and logic description.
* For internal APIs or unfamiliar libraries, add detailed context (e.g., linked files, usage examples).

> Complex integrations often work best when prompts are split into multiple clear steps. Combine repo search + natural language queries for optimal results.

---

## üßπ 5. **Code Refactoring**

* Split large functions, simplify logic, or reorganize files using Windsurf‚Äôs **Refactor** command or inline tools.
* Scope-specific refactoring is enabled through **@-mentions**, code lenses, or file-level targeting.

> When refactoring large files or full projects, break the process into logical phases due to context limitations (\~16,000 tokens). Multi-step ‚Äúcascading‚Äù refactoring across the repo is on the roadmap.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Best Practices Across All Use Cases**

1. **Leverage Context Wisely**
   Use open files, @-mentions, and pinning to help the model understand exactly what you‚Äôre working on.

2. **Break Tasks into Steps**
   For complex operations like test generation, API integration, or multi-function refactoring, decompose your prompt into small, manageable tasks.

3. **Use Built-in Tools Effectively**
   Tap into **Next Completion**, **FIM**, **Refactor button**, and Chat for different phases of your workflow.

4. **Validate Output**
   Always review and test generated code‚Äîespecially for edge cases, sensitive logic, or integrations.

---

## üß† Summary

Windsurf is highly effective for:

* Automating standard or repetitive code tasks
* Creating unit tests and test data
* Documenting and explaining existing code
* Generating and documenting APIs
* Refactoring code for better maintainability
