### What is Machine Learning

**What is Machine Learning:**

Find patterns in data. Use those patterns to predict the future.

**What does it mean to Learn:**

**Machine Learning in a Nutshell:**

1. You find data that contains patterns
2. Feed that data into machine learning algorithms to find patterns in the data
3. That algorithm generate something as known - Model. A model - functionality that can recognize patterns with new data.
4. Application - supplies new data to model to see if it matches known patterns. 

Please see the example ![diagram1](./pictures/ml-in-nutshell.png)

**What is a data scientist:**

Someone who knows about:

- Statistics

- Machine learning software

- Some problem domain(ideally)

### The Machine Learning Process is:

The First Problem: **Asking the Right Question**

- Ask yourself: Do you have the right data to answer this question?

- Do you know how you'll measure success?

- Model: how good those predictions must be to make this process qualify to make it success?


The Machine Learning process:

1. To start you choose that data(what data is more likely to be predictive)

2. Prepared data to be ready for processing, basically apply pre-processing to data (clean, organize, format, get it prepared)

3. Applying learning algorithms to that prepared data.

4. Create candidate Model -  iterate to find the best model

5. Deploy chosen model

Please see the example ![diagram2](./pictures/ml-process.png)


The next step is repeating the Machine Learning process regulary:


Please see the example ![diagram3](./pictures/repeating-ml-process.png)


### Machine-Learning Concepts:

**Terminology:**

*Training data* - prepared data to use to create Model

*Supervised learning* - the value you want to predict is in the training data. The data is labeled.

*Unsupervised learning* - the value you want to predict is not in the training data. The data is unlabeled.


### Data Pre-processing with Supervised Learning:

Training-data, please see the example ![diagram4](./pictures/training-data.png)


**Categorizing Machine Learning Problems: Regression**

please see the example ![diagram5](./pictures/regression.png)


**Categorizing Machine Learning Problems: Classification**

please see the example ![diagram6](./pictures/classification.png)


**Categorizing Machine Learning Problems: Clustering**

please see the example ![diagram7](./pictures/clustering.png)


**Styles of Machine Learning Algorithms:**

please see the example ![diagram8](./pictures/ml-algorithms.png)

**Training a Model with Supervised Learning: Choose Features**

please see the example ![diagram9](./pictures/training-with-supervised.png)


**Testing a Model with Supervised Learning: Test the results and compare target values generated from test data  with actual target values**

please see the example ![diagram10](./pictures/test-with-supervised.png)


**Improve a Model with Supervised Learning: Some Options**

please see the example ![diagram11](./pictures/improve-with-supervised.png)


**Using a Model:**

please see the example ![diagram12](./pictures/using-model.png)



## 2. ML with Python

**Machine Learning Logic**

1. Data - get data and modify into format that ML can use

2. Algorithm - pass these data into algorithm

3. Data Analysis - analyses these data and create a model

4. Model - solution to solve the problem based on input data

**Machine Learning Technique Comparison:**
